                Like many Calgary success stories, ours has a spirited beginning, an unprecedent
                growth spurt and a promising future.

            Even before Alberta became a province in September 1905, the citizens of a very young Calgary were
            determined to host a post-secondary institution as part of building a great city.

                In 1906, the Alberta Normal School (which would later become our own Werklund School of Education) began
                operations and provided a steady stream of educators for a new province eager to grow and advance
                quickly.

                When the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Strathcona (now part of Edmonton), Calgarians were
                disappointed with the "branch plant" concept that ensued and lobbied for decades for an independent
                institution of their own. Students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors and volunteers joined together to
                support the cause, with great passion and commitment.

                Their dedication was finally rewarded on April 29, 1966 when the University of Calgary was granted
                autonomy. From there, growth was fast and furious, as a new campus took shape and innovative educators
                came to Calgary from around the world.
